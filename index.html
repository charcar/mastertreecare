                    <p>  Outstanding Operation; I would highly recommend. Tom responded to my inquiry in a timely manner, returned phone calls, and was on time. It was a pleasure to deal with Tom and his crew. He came out, carefully looked things over, then worked with me to determine the best course of action. He was able to schedule the work within a week. The work was done expertly and with great care... Clean-up: Great! You'd never know anyone was there. I would hire Tom again without a doubt. It is especially good that Tom is the owner, estimator, and also does the work.</p>

                    <p>Tom's crew hazard-pruned and thinned our three large Douglas firs in the backyard, then chipped the debris and hauled it away. We had received an estimate for the work back in September of 2015 and didn't schedule the work until June of 2016. Tom still honored his estimate... The trees look wonderful and I believe they actually left our yard cleaner than they found it. Our fir trees are huge and loom above live power lines, so the crew didn't have an easy task. We were very pleased with their work and wouldn't hesitate to hire them again for future jobs.</p>

                    <p>Cut down a large maple tree from our backyard whose roots had lifted our driveway and walkway. It was right next to a shed, with limbs on the shed, on the house, and well over the fence to the neighbors yard. It went smoothly, they worked steadily all day... They stacked the larger limbs for us, and the very large limbs and trunk were cut to 16 inch lengths, which they stacked for us to split later, as requested... The yard, shed roof, deck, driveway and walks were swept and blown clean. Great job, no problems, and no damage. And the neighbors were impressed and asked for the company name.</p>
